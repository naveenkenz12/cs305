Introduction to cross compiler

1.	A cross compiler is a compiler that is capable of creating executable code for a platform other than the platform on which the compiler is running.
	eg. a compiler running on a linux machine and generating code for MIPS is a cross compiler.

2.	The host platform is the platform where the output artifacts from the compiler will be executed.

3.	The target platform is the platform that is used when cross compiling cross compilers. It represents what type of object code, the package itself will produce.

host plateform : linux(x86)
target platform : mips

Instruction Count

1. written assembly code
		gcd_basic.s		81
		fibonacci_basic.s	2172	

2. non optimized code
		gcd_noopt.s		153
		fibonacci_noopt.s		3242

3. optimized 


Differences
1. compiler code saves frame pointer  in stack.All caller and callee registers are saved in stack
