		explanation :
			Direct mapping.
			As the cache size increases, the number of memory address that is mapped to a particular address decreases.
			This decreases the number of non-cumpulsory misses. However number of compulsory missies at start will be there
			for any value of cache size. Thus, when number of nun-cumpulsory mises tends to zero, total demand misses will reach
			to a minimum saturation level due to cumpulsory misses.

		2 way associativity, cache size = 8 KB

		explanation :
			With increase in the block size, the number of instruction fetched at a time increases, this decrese the cache miss
			(both cumpulsory and non-cumpolsary) due to satial locality of code and data, and reaches the minimum optimal value 
			possible at the specified value of associativity and cache size.

			But after certain block size(about 256 Bytes), cache miss rate start increasing, extra data are cached at a time when block 
			size. Total cache size of 4KB here gets filled withe data even if that is not need. But the data which is in reality needed
			is not cached and thus there is more cache miss.

		explanation : 
			As the associativity(number of blocks per set) increases, the rate of cache miss decreases. As associativity increases, conflict miss decreases.
			
			Later with the increase in associativity beyond a certain limit at the specified value of cache size and block size, the miss rate remains almost same, as number of blocks per set increases.

			Later with much more increase in associativity, conflict increases a bit because of less number of distinct sets.
