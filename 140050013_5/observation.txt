3. single cycle = 153
Multiple cycle = 647
Multi Cycle is 1.18238021638 times faster.

let clock period per instruction= t (in single cycle implementation)
let clock period per instruction= t/5 (in multi cycle implementation)

time for 153 instructions in single cycle = 153*t
time for 647 instructions in single cycle = 647*t/5

ratio = 153*t*5/(647*t) = 1.1823(approx)
